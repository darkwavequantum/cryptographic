# Zero Knowledge Proof
It is possible for a prover to convince verifier that  a statement is true without leaking any information.
It must satisfy 3 conditions:
1. Completeness:  If the statement is true, the honest verifier is convinced truth of this statement by the honeset prover
2. Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover cannot convince the honest verifier the the truth of this statement.[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness)
3. Zero-Knowledge: If the statement is true, no cheating verifier learns any information except the truth of the statement.

# Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof
No interaction is necessary between prover and verifier
