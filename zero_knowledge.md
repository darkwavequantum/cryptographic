# Zero Knowledge Proof
It is possible for a prover to convince verifier that  a statement is true without leaking any information.
It must satisfy 3 conditions:
1. Completeness:  If the statement is true, the honest verifier is convinced truth of this statement by the honeset prover
2. Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover cannot convince the honest verifier the the truth of this statement.[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness)
3. Zero-Knowledge: If the statement is true, no cheating verifier learns any information except the truth of the statement.

# Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof
No interaction is necessary between prover and verifier


# Quadratic Span Programs
Characterization of the NP complexity class. It's exten of span programs.

# Terminalogy
Sound: reasonable
Soundness: Justifiability. Rightfulness
Witness: prover of relevant  event
succinctness: concision
SNARKs: succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge: 简洁的非交互性知识论证
